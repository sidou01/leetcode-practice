/* Problem 747 */

/* In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element. */

/* Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. */

/* If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1. */

/* Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0] */
/* Output: 1 */
/* Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x, */
/* 6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1. */
